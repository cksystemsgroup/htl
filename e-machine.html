	<h3>Abstract</h3>
	<i>
	The so called E(mbedded ) Machine, is a virtual machine that interprets the 
	E code. Here the E code that is interpreted is generated by the HTL compiler, 
	but it could be any E code. The instructions set consists of 6 instructions:
	<ul>
		<li><b>call</b> – executes a driver, a driver is a piece of code 
		written in a conventional language (in this case C);
		
		<li><b>release</b> – releases a task, the task function is also written 
		in a conventional language ( C );
		
		<li><b>future</b> – mark a piece of E code to be executed at some 
		future time;
		
		<li><b>jump</b> – unconditioned jump to a specified address;
		
		<li><b>if</b> – conditioned jump to a specified address;
		
		<li><b>return</b> – stops the E Machine from executing E code until
		an event occuers;
	</ul>

	<h3>How To Run It?</h3>
	First you have to download the E Machine <a href="./files/e-machine.tar.gz">
	sources</a>.
	<br>
	<br>
	To build the E Machine:
	<ul>
		<li>edit the “<b>makefile</b>” to change the “EXAMPLE” definition to point to the 
		file you want to compile;
		
		<li> type “<b>make all</b>” to compile the htl example program and build the E 
		Machine;
		
		<li>type “<b>make all host=[host_name]</b>” to build the E Machine for specified 
		host.
	</ul>

	To run the E Machine:
	<ul>
		<li>type “<b>./e-machine</b>” to run the E Machine for non-distributed programs;
		
		<li>type “<b>./e-machine [ID]</b>” to run the E Machine for the host with the 
		specified ID, the ID corresponds to the order in which the hosts appear in the HTL f
		ile, starting from 0.
	</ul>
