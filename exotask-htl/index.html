			<h3>Abstract</h3>
			<p class="abstract">
			The main goal of the project is to implement full semantics of the 
			<a href="http://htl.cs.uni-salzburg.at">Hierarchical Timing Language</a> using 
			<a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xrtgs">Exotask</a> framework. 
			The Exotask HTL framework consists of two parts: (1) the Eclipse plug-in 
			which can be used during development of a real-time application, and (2) 
			the runtime which contains all classes needed to run an Exotask HTL 
			real-time application.

			<h3>Download and Installation</h3>
			
			You can download source code <a href="./files/exotaskHTLsrc.zip">here</a>.<br>
			You can download Exotask HTL <b>plug-in</b> binary distribution <a href="./files/at.uni_salzburg.cs.exotasks.editor.timing.htl_1.1.0.zip">here</a>.<br>
			You can download Exotask HTL <b>runtime</b> binary distribution <a href="./files/exotaskHTL-runtime.jar">here</a>.<br>
			<br>
			Before you install Exotask HTL project you have to make sure that you have
			already installed the Exotask framework (for details on how to install Exotask
			framework click <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xrtgs">here</a>). 
			After you have successfully installed Exotask frame you just have to unzip the plug-in 
			binary distribution of the Exotask HTL Editor into Eclipse "plugins" directory.

			<h3>Short description on how the graphical editor works.</h3>
			<p class="text">
			After the Exotask HTL plug-in was installed a new timing grammar is added to the Exotask editor 
			palette, the new timing is called HTL Timing. An HTL Timing grammar has the following properties: 
			<ul>
			 <li>Program List – specifies the list of program in the HTL program</li>
			 <li>Module List – specifies the list of modules in the HTL program, each module has to belong to 
			     one and only one program</li>
			 <li>Mode List – specifies the list of modes in the HTL program, each mode belongs to one and only 
			     one module and can be refined by a program</li>
			</ul>
			Defining the HTL program structure (e.g., define programs, modules and modes) has to be done prior 
			to added any other element to the graph. All the elements that can be added to an exotask graph have 
			to types of properties: (a) properties common to all grammars, and (b) properties specific to each 
			grammar, here I will discuss only those properties that are specific to HTL Timing grammar. 
			</p>
			<p class="text">
			<b><i>Communicator</i></b> - a communicator has a period (the period specifies how often communicator can be 
			accessed, e.g. read or written), and belongs to one and only one program.
			</p>
			<p class="text">
			<b><i>Exotask</i></b> - an exotask can be abstract or not, can have a parent task, and has to 
			specify a list of modes in which the task can be invoked. An abstract exotask is just a place 
			holder for a task that is invoked in one of the modes in the refining programs; it will not be 
			invoked at runtime. Any task invoked in a refining program has to specify a parent task. 
			Two tasks can not be invoked in two different modes that can be run in parallel.
			</p>
			<p class="text">
			<b><i>Predicate</i></b> - has to specify a list of modes in which it will be invoked, and one 
			destination mode. Two predicates can not be invoked in two different modes that can be run in parallel
			</p>
			<p class="text">
			<b><i>Connection</i></b> - has to specify the list of modes in which the connection is invoked, 
			if the connection reads or writes a communicator then it has to specify an instance greater then -1, 
			otherwise the instance has to be equal to -1 (the instance represents the instance of the communicator 
			being accessed relative to the period of the mode in which the connection is invoked), if a connection 
			writes to a communicator then the “Write Communicator” property has to be set to true. Two connections 
			can not be invoked in two different modes that can be run in parallel.
			</p>

			<h3>Case study</h3>
			<p class="text">
			The case study consists of a simple program that adds a value to a counter until a threshold (we call 
			this addition threshold) is reach, after the addition threshold was reached the value is subtracted 
			until the subtraction threshold is reached, when we switch back to addition. The value of the addition 
			step gets higher as the value of the counter gets closer to the addition threshold. The value of the 
			subtraction step gets lower as the value of the counter gets closer to the subtraction threshold. In 
			parallel with the addition or subtraction operations another counter is multiplied or divided with a 
			certain factor, again the factor that the counter is multiplied (divided) increases (decreases) as the 
			counter value gets closer to the multiplication (division) threshold.
			</p>
			<p class="text">
			The HTL Exotask program consists of a root program with three modules: one module for the addition and 
			subtraction, one module for multiplication and division, and another module that writes the values of 
			the counters. The root program also contains two communicators one for each of the two counters. The 
			addition and subtraction module contains one mode that is refined by a program which contains one module 
			with two modes (one for addition and the other one for subtraction), the two modes can switch from one 
			another, the two modes are farther refined by two programs each of them contains one module and three 
			modes, so that we have there different addition (subtraction) steps. The structure of the multiplication 
			(division) module is similar to that of the addition (subtraction) module that was previously presented.
